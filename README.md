# Launch Countdown Web App

Welcome to my Launch Countdown Web App repository. This project is a solution to the Launch Countdown Web App challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## The Challenge

The challenge involved building an application that allowed users to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- SASS (BEM approach)
